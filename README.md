Hey,

this project was done when I was in highschool for a computer science class(Comp sci 30), and it was my second time ever working with anything Arduino. 

I completed this with a good friend and do not take full credit for anything here; I do note that we practically did everything together, with the exception of pressing buttons on our keyboards
and soldering.

Like the auto boat, I did not save much. The reason for this is slightly different—we wanted to give our electronics back to the school so other students could use them. We figured that
was best as I was entering grade 12 next year with a full schedule, and he was leaving for Aerospace Eng at UofT.

That said, for each of these classes we needed to make a website. Regarding the ones I had, I cannot access them since they were coded on Adobe Dreamweaver 2022 which now has a paywall upon logging in;
however, Leo likely still has access to his and hopefully one day I can add it here for memory sake.

The purpose of this being on github is to showcase to my employer proof that I have worked on this project. That said, I am not going to rehash anything that is already on my resume; I am not going to give much more expository here (you either have access to it in the projects and such pdf, or you can ask me personally).

Also Employer, I knew nothing about how to code back then; not even basic principles like the factory method...


Electronics used were:
BMP-280, MPU-6050 IMU, Lora32u4ii x 2,, SG90 servos, HC-12 x 2, NEO-6M GPS Module
